How to chile mite charcoal

The marsh bird is "devilish demon", it met people from afar have rushed to fly away, disappeared into the tree lush can not see the toothpick slightly! Warblers are very haggard even though they prefer to live near people.

In wildlife, live chickens live in the garden, nesting season in the trees in the garden, and usually each garden about seven to five acres to a sample is a pair of sticks. Charcoal occupies the ground. Sometimes in the garden there are also three other extraterrestrial pythons, which are homeless birds, reaching up to three worms to go to other places, not dare to dwell in the garden.

The main food of the pythons is worms, worms are always available in the garden. If they meet fruit like bananas, mango also visit mine to enjoy, eat to let live through the day, but they do not love this.

Everyone knows that the wormhole is worm-eaten, but no one uses the worm to lure it. The important thing that tdcc wants to tell you is that even though the warblers love to eat earthworms, we should not feed them worms, eat worms, It does not help the birds stretch the fire as deep eat, eat rakes scraping ant eggs.

Because the charcoal charcoal is very rocky, people use the green to catch it. Trapped charcoal is very fun, as bird prey as the voice of the bird has come from. There is one thing you can only hit one garden, so you have to move through the garden. However, one lucky day can also hit ten children. ! In the breeding season of the Coleoptera are often flying pairs of pairs, so sometimes catching both females. When you catch the female you should release it, so it continues to reproduce. Noxious peasants do not raise the "lug" for the bird as pigeon spray, fire, so most people do not feed

The domestication of the warbler

Need to pick the best puppies, new breeding. Birds that are not properly rated, you drop them into the forest, because raising them only takes a lot of money, not useful.

The bird is called true standard is the bird has a beautiful body like his big, long blow, the head is not "broken", the eyes are intact, the legs are not cut, fingers and toes are not broken ...

This is just a round trip car, but the first, second, third. There are so many choices to choose the birds singing or good. And after each such selection, the birds looked out to be inadequate, of course being released to the wild, but no meat.

It is worth saying that doing so is not a waste of money, as you know the price to buy a prickly charcoal 130k - 180k.

What is most worrying about the domestication of bird birds is how to raise the bird and how to survive the new habitat.

To put it more clearly, the first wish of a mullah owner is to expect the bird to live for the first ten days. Everyone knows that in the first ten days that moths live, it looks like things are no longer worth worrying about.

The first time the bird was still alive, which meant that it was fed with flour, fed deeply in captivity in a cramped cage. The owner was very happy. Because charcoal feces are very difficult to raise in the first time, the farmer is also lost, more or less many people who do not raise ten children can live all ten.

When they are too afraid, they only stand in a corner of the cage, then to wither to withstand, to weaken and die. The children who take on the bridge are the relatively bold, hope to bear to eat eating eating.
 
There were moths in the air, people who heard loud explosions, or strong noises as they flew.

In order to feed live charcoal sparrows, we must first have a cassava of 48 bamboo rafts (or 52 nannas are also preferred), cover the cage carefully so that when the birds are not visible strange scenery, outside that scared more. Inside the cage, hang a plate of peanut meal mixed with eggs. An egg rack is one of the most popular birds in the wildlife, a deep fresh, and two tablespoons of drinking water.

When the birds come in, they must find a quiet place to hang cages, and in the first few days the farmer has to visit nothing, just ignore it. The amount of food and water
