Land sticks have fairly strong legs and are used flexibly to move on the ground. Stingrays usually stand up to the tail, blinding wings like a dance, like a body language to attract a landlord.
Characteristics of land sting

The prickly-pitched prickly-pitched and shrill voices are slightly smaller than the other subspecies of the prickleys. So they choose quiet times to sing, and they sing at about 12-13. In the evening they sing again at 23 o'clock. They choose such harsh hours in nature, they want to express their special feelings with other landlords. And another reason, their small voice can be overwhelmed, if they sing the same time with other songbirds.

 
With such small singing, when the songbirds vacate the song to add more attention to birds. These behaviors are referred to as tail spreading, wing dancing. It can be said that when the jargon is singing, there is no bird singing as well as dancing (as it is personal). is one of the reasons that today, the movement of warbands in Vietnam is favored.

Reclamation of breeding ground begins in spring to summer, which is around January, the peak is March to June. Around the time of the sparrow, the females were dark brown, the white patches on the body lost their bony underparts. Their reds were ready-to-use hollows such as the wall, rock niches or soil tissues. There are small grasses or shrubs that cover private or existing lands and are lined with hay, algae or animal hair.

There are two to five oval, light greenish-pinkish or brownish-brown eggs with a length of about 1.2-1.5 cm. Eggs are incubated for about 14 days, hatching, 30 days young birds are coloring birds as young birds, the front of the brown speckled brown spots. Young adults mature three months later.
