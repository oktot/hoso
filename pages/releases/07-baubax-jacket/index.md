About Us
BauBax came into existence by husband and wife team, Hiral Sanghavi and Yoganshi Sanghavi.  Traveling for work and leisure Hiral purchased over 9 travel pillows in less than 3 months’ time. Yoganshi, the lead designer, invented the jacket + travel organizer now branded as BauBax. The only problem here wasn't just the pillow!

Powered by this original idea, Hiral and Yoganshi, sat down together and brain-stormed their way to a travel jacket which had multiple features and which addressed a lot of inconveniences that travelers faced.
