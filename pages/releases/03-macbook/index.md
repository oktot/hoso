I've working longtime in Windows Program, and Windows PC. for 10 years.

It's relly hard to working on the low quality production. but it's gave me some of experience.

Right now, i though that Macbook Pro is the great way to moving on. Why? Because it perform great, and have good quality and defended with the virus.

## Check the Price


it's listed as well in Apple shop with the price range from $1,299.00 to $1,599.00. This price if pay for something could used for more years, i would love to pay for it.

Thanks a lot Steven Jobs.
