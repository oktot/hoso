The Nebia Shower System is a new shower technology developed on the notion that the more water that comes into contact with your skin, the more you will enjoy the experience. To create a 360° experience, our team of thermofluids experts developed the H2Micro atomizing technology that breaks down water into millions of tiny droplets released in precise patterns. Nebia increases the total surface area of water by 10X, all while using up to 70% less water (0.7 gpm). Described as stepping into a warm cloud, Nebia is like a steam room experience blended with an invigorating shower. The experience is soothing and immersive and your skin feeling cleansed and refreshed. 

Developed with the same software used to study jet engines, Nebia fine-tuned every detail to create the perfect balance of comfort and efficiency, rinsing products from even the thickest hair. The average home of 4 will save approximately 20,000 gallons of water per year.  

The Nebia Shower System was designed in San Francisco and is built in the U.S.A.

In a world of constant notifications and endless to-do lists, the shower is the one time of the day where you can relax and recharge. We think of this time as sacred, and through Nebia, we bring you the soothing pleasures of a steam room with the invigorating nature of a shower. The water gently cleanses your skin, and you are immersed in warmth from above and from the side. Take your time knowing you are using a fraction of the water you normally would.



When you have somewhere to be, there is sometimes no time to indulge in a long shower. For a practical no-fuss shower, slide the Arm 3-6" above you, turn on the strength mode and use the Wand as a hand shower to rinse quickly and efficiently. If you don’t want to get your hair wet, slide the Arm all the way down and tilt the head towards you. 

 

For all children, from ages 5 to 95.


Nebia is the ideal shower for children. With 25” of vertical sliding, it can always fit them just right (especially when they grow up so fast!). You won’t have to lecture your teenager after spending too long in the shower or using all of the hot water. Plus, using Nebia is a great example to encourage water conservation from a young age.

Features & Specs
25” Sliding Arm: Very few showers are designed to be used by people of different heights, and those that do have clunky knobs or buttons. We knew it was time for a simpler experience with more range. Like magic, the Nebia Shower System glides 25 inches up and down to customize the spray pattern for every member of the family so that it always fits just right.
The Wand and Magnetic Dock: To create the ultimate 360° experience, turn on the Wand to activate a simultaneous side spray. It can be used as a hand shower or can be positioned on the Magnetic Dock. 
Strength Mode: Turn on an extra boost of water for a more traditional sensation of pressure while still saving up to 60% of the water compared to a conventional shower.
Head Tilt: For the days you don’t want to get your hair wet, slide the Arm down and tilt the Head towards your chest. 
Easy Self-Installation: No need to call a plumber or break any tiles: Nebia is easy to self-install and comes with a set of custom tools. Watch our 3 min Install Video.
